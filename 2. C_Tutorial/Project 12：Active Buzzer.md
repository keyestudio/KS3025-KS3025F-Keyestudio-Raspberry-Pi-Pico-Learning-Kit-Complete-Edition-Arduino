# Project 12：Active Buzzer

1.**Introduction**

Active buzzer is a sound making element, widely used on computers, printers, alarms, electronic toys, telephones, timers, etc. It has an inner vibration source. In this project, we will use a PLUS control board to control the active buzzer to buzz.

3.**Component Knowledge**

The active buzzer inside has a simple oscillator circuit which can convert constant direct current into a certain frequency pulse signal. Once active buzzer receives a high level, it will sound. 

The passive buzzer is an integrated electronic buzzer with no internal vibration source. It must be driven by 2K to 5K square wave instead of a DC signal. The appearance of the two buzzers is very similar, but passive buzzers come with a green circuit board, and active buzzers come with a black tape. Passive buzzers don't have positive pole, but active buzzers have.

Note:

1.  The power supply of the buzzer is 5V. With a 3.3V supply, the buzzer will work, but it will beep weakly.
    
2.  VUSB should be connected to the positive side of the USB cable, if it is connected to GND, it may burn out the computer or Raspberry Pi Pico. Also, be careful when wiring the Raspberry Pi Pico pins 36-40 to avoid short circuits.
    
3.  The positive pole (“+”/long pin) of the active buzzer is connected to pin 16, and the negative pole (short pin) is connected to GND.

5.**Test Code：** 

You can open the code we provide:

Go to the folder KS3025 Keyestudio Raspberry Pi Pico Learning Kit Complete Edition\\2. Windows System\\2. C\_Tutorial\\2. Projects\\Project 12：Active Buzzer\\Project\_12\_Active\_Buzzer

```C
/* 
 * Filename    : Active Buzzer
 * Description : Active buzzer beeps.
 * Auther      : http//www.keyestudio.com
*/
#define buzzerPin  16   //define buzzer pins

void setup ()
{
  pinMode (buzzerPin, OUTPUT);
}
void loop ()
{
  digitalWrite (buzzerPin, HIGH);
  delay (500);
  digitalWrite (buzzerPin, LOW);
  delay (500);
}
```
